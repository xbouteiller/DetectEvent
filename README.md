Current version is: **1.0**

<img src="img/2021-03-08_15-43_1.png" width="75%" height="75%">

## What's new in this release ?

### Major changes
- RMSE change detection method is implemented on differentiated signal
- Arg parser was added : It can be used in order to change manually some parameters before computation

### Example of uses
Good results was obtained with the following configuration:

>
> python Leaf_exec.py -tr 4 -fr 2 -td 2 -fd 2 
> python Leaf_exec.py --transfo_rmse 4 --fit_rmse 2 --transfo_diff 2 --fit_diff 2 
>
That's mean:

- the 'raw' signal :
    - transformation of the raw measures with a log(y) when fitting model from the end to the start & and 1/exp(y) when fitting model from the start to the end
    - model fitted is only a linear regression 

- the 'differentiated' signal :
    - transformation of the raw measures with a log(y) when fitting model from the end to the start & and no transformation when fitting model from the start to the end
    - model fitted is only a linear regression 

In order to get the original method of the program (i.e. no data transformation & A*expt-B*t fitted when fitting model from start to end):
>
> python Leaf_exec.py -tr 1 -fr 1 -td 1 -fd 1
>

or

>
> python Leaf_exec.py

## Program possibilities

#### RMSE approach

- Objective is to detect curve's changing point (i.e the point where the curve shift from an exponential function to a linear function)
- Exponential function is fitted from left to right and linear function is fitted from right to left
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is computed and it is expected that the 2 errors cross  approximately at the curve's changing point
- Several computed parameters are extracted and saved within a csv file (as Gmin)


#### Robust differential method

- Use a robust differential method (Chartrand, 2011) to compute conductance from raw data 
- Conductance is further differentiated in order to detect peak


## Data

Data must be stored within files
For a better files recognition, first row of the csv file should contain the string "conductance" otherwise all csv from a folder will be parsed

Columns should be named as follow


#### Quantitative columns

- weight_g : leaf weight as a function of time (g)
- T_C : temperature (Â°C)
- RH : Relative Humidity
- Patm : atmospheric pressure (KPa)
- Area_m2 : area of the leaf (m2)

#### Qualitative columns

- campaign : campaign name
- sample_ID : ID of the sample, should be unique for each sample

#### Date

- date_time : time (best with the format YEAR/MONTH/DAY HOUR:MINUTE )


## Program flow


#### Step 1
1. The program ask to chose a folder that will be parsed 
<img src="img/2021-03-08_15-41_1.png" width="75%" height="75%">

#### Step 2
2. A method for detecting conductancefiles must be chosen. There is two possibilities : either the program detect all .csv file or the program detect files containing the string "conductance" in the first row. Number of detected files within folder will be printed in the console.

### Step 3
3. You have to chose which method you will use: either the RMSE approach or the robust differential approach
<img src="img/2021-03-08_15-42_1.png" width="75%" height="75%">

The following steps are for the RMSE approach
#### Step 4
4. The software proposes to work on raw data or smoothed data. It is often preferable to work on smoothed data.

Smoothing parameters can be adjusted. See the lowess method from the statsmodels library.

#### Step 5
5. The program plot the detected crossing points, and print the value in the console.
<img src="img/2021-03-08_15-43_1.png" width="75%" height="75%">
Gmin is computed using a linear regression from the detected crossing point to the end of the data.
<img src="img/2021-03-08_16-21.png" width="75%" height="75%">
It is also possible to select manually on the graph 1 or 2 crossing points. if 2 points are selected, Gmin is computed between this 2 points. See the black line below.

#### Step 6
6. Other files & sample ID within each file are analyzed, then a output folder is created & a data frame is saved within this folder.

For the conductance approach. Step are very similar. It is also possible to work on raw or smoothed data. It is possbile to adjust the regularization parameters of the derivative function (see cited reference below). Then, peaks are detected, it is also possible to select the peaks manually. Please note that this method is still under development.
